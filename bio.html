    <p>large systems. Her work has dealt with themes related to values ​​surrounding excessive consumption and control, kawaii (cuteness),</p>
    <p>femininity and the sense of pain, and pop and mass culture. She works across a range of fields, including composition, curation, experimental</p>
    <p>music performance, and visual art. She continues to create opportunities and spaces for exploration and dialogue through sound.</p>
